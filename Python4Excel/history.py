    <h1>Who Is Michael Stonebraker?</h1>

        -Michael Ralph Stonebraker is a computer scientist that loved to work with new database programs and specialize in them; he was  
really experienced at it too. His whole career started throughout college at the University of California. Stonebraker loved doing what  
he was working with at the very moment so he decided to get together with a college and give himself a challenge and that challenge was  
to create a new relational database we all now know today called PostgreSQL.

        -Michael Stonebraker is what we call, "an old one" as he was born on October 11th, 1943 in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Michael   
seemed to have an unknown/unspecified childhood meaning it was high likely Stonebraker kept his childhood a secret although his college 
career seemed to be his big hit and where he started his journey into PostgreSQL.

	-PostgreSQL's implementation begun back in 1986 and the first operational project was released in 1987 although, only developers 
had certain access to this database at the time since it was not ready to be published to the world yet. After running a couple of test 
throughout 1987-1988, it's first public database was released to a small audience for testing. After receiving feedback from the 
following testers, PostgreSQL started releasing new versions for testers in a repetitive pattern until PostgreSQL was finally released to 
the world in 1995 and went by the name as Postgres95 but throughout 1996, developers seemed to come to a conclusion that the name just 
didn't seem right and came to a vote to rename it to what we now all know today as PostgreSQL.
