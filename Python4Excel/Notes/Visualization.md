	- What is Data Visualization?

- Data Visualization is a graphical representation of information and data or in simpile 
terms, it is the data used in common graphics such as charts, plots, infographics, and 
etc; Even in Google Charts or Google Spreadsheet we are experiencing Data Visualization 
but of course we may not notice that.

- When users such as us decides to give Data Visualization a look, it gives us a clear 
and bright idea of what the information is telling us for example, through maps or 
graphs.

	- Why is Data Visualization so Important?

- Honestly, without Data Visualization, most of the following resources/applications we 
use in today's world wouldn't even exist because half of the resources we use has 
Visualization inside of it and even if the smallest part of it wasn't existent, programs 
could go malfunction easily.

- Yes, we can as well create a program/system without Data Visualization but things such 
as that would make the job for the developer much harder so use Visualization !!

	- How can I work with Data Visualization?

- Data Visualization is not too easy nor too hard to work with but tips that can help you 
get a good look on is establishing a goal and audience you want for your visualization 
meaning you should decide what category you want your Data Visualization style fall in 
and getting the right audience meaning, who do you want testing/giving suggestions on 
your charts?

- Practice always makes perfect as well of course! Some recommended applications is Google
Charts, Datawrapper, and Chartblocks!
