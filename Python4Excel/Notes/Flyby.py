<h1>Flyby Summary</h1>

	- As Dee is in need for precise flyby times, the chapter is starting off with her getting ready to access the mission data and play around with it.
	
	- After hours of looking for ways to filter data, Dee finally gets into the target table that allows her to know what planet/moon the mission plan was focusing on.

	- As Dee is searching the term "flyby" or "fly by" she runs into a quick problem that she immediately fixes after a bit of concentration and specifying her columns 
after noticing they all were just chained together into one and loose.

	- Dee is now searching for anything that could be considered a flyby value and wants to make sure her query is incase sensitive.

	- After finally finding her flyby values, she notices something and its that all flyby values were given a two letter name which was either "TA", "TB", "TI", or 
"EI" and what the first letter represented was either a target, letter, or number following the incremented count.

	- Dee now wants to take advantage of this pattern and get control of it and as she notices that her Titan flybys all start with a t and have a number following 
them, she decides to use regex to construct an elaborate where clause.

	- After noticing a query that  checks all titles that start with the letter "T" and have one or more numbers following ending in "flyby", she notices about 121 rows 
of Titan flybys.

	- Dee decides to now expand the filter to isolate flybys and while looking, she notices a "TA" and "TB" flyby name someone must've sneaked in and instead of asking 
for support/help on fixing this, she comes up with a better idea of just going back to the old query.

	- As Dee is now in the old query, she needs to now add a couple expressions to the query so she can work with the data later on and because she knows that running 
it will give her an incredibly long piece of text, she turns on expand view.

	- Before Dee is done with her job for the day, she needs to give her data a spot check to make sure everything is well organized with no errors but what she notices 
is that her first Enceladus is not in the spot it usually is which is a problem so what she does is crosscheck the source and investigate more into the data shes seeing. 

	- After querying the source table, she found where her first Enceladus was but notices another title named "Obtain wideband examples of lightning whistlers" and is 
curious about what a lightning whistler even is!!

	- This chapter then ends in after a bit of research, Dee finding out that this was as well another flyby and after a long fun but frustrating day, Dee finally heads 
home.
