<h1>RAID</h1>

	RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID uses 
multiple disk drives to store its own fraction of the same data and then 
reads each drive at the same time in order to improve performance and 
sometimes failure tolerance. Having multiple disks with smaller size data 
to read is much faster than one high power drive with all of the data on 
it, and having backups of the data with Parity Data can prevent loss of 
data even if a disk fails. Norman Ken Ouchi from IBM designed a RAID 
system in 1974 which would later be called RAID 4 and patented it in 1977. 
The term RAID was coined in 1987 by David Patterson, Randy Katz and Garth 
A. Gibson.
