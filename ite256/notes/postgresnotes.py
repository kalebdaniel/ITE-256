<title>Postgres Notes and Facts</title>

	<h1>What is Postgres?</h1>
		
		- As readers may know, Postgres is one of the world's most advanced open sourced database which has been around for over twenty years with a release date of 
on July 8th, 1996.
		
		- Reasons for Postgres being one of the most useful and advanced databases is for starters because it allows large bits of data to be stored safely instead 
of overloading the machine. Having benefits such as this could be incredibly useful towards working in the computer field.

		- Postgres has both it's advantages and disadvantages as an incredible advantage is that Postgres' source code is openly available under a source license 
allowing anyone and everyone use Postgres towards business needs and wants. Disadvantages of Postgres can be as minor as it not being owned by one organization or as major 
as it may be much slower than other databases.

	<h1>The Creator of Postgres</h1>

		-Michael Ralph Stonebraker is a computer scientist that loved to work with new database programs and specialize in them; 
he was really experienced at it too. His whole career started throughout college at the University of California. Stonebraker loved doing 
what he was working with at the very moment so he decided to get together with a college and give himself a challenge and that challenge was
to create a new relational database we all now know today called PostgreSQL.

        -Michael Stonebraker is what we call, "an old one" as he was born on October 11th, 1943 in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Michael
seemed to have an unknown/unspecified childhood meaning it was high likely Stonebraker kept his childhood a secret although his college
career seemed to be his big hit and where he started his journey into PostgreSQL.

        -PostgreSQL's implementation begun back in 1986 and the first operational project was released in 1987 although, only developers
had certain access to this database at the time since it was not ready to be published to the world yet. After running a couple of test
throughout 1987-1988, it's first public database was released to a small audience for testing. After receiving feedback from the
following testers, PostgreSQL started releasing new versions for testers in a repetitive pattern until PostgreSQL was finally released to
the world in 1995 and went by the name as Postgres95 but throughout 1996, developers seemed to come to a conclusion that the name just
didn't seem right and came to a vote to rename it to what we now all know today as PostgreSQL.
